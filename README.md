# PROTOCOL

*Tombola* is a board game originated in Italy. In Turkey, it is called *Tombala* and traditionally played in new year's eve. It's similar to *bingo* game.

This document defines functional requirements for a simple tombala game and offers a simple text-based protocol desing which will be used for communication between Tombala Clients and Tombala Server. The protocol is designed to run on top of the TCP.

This protocol is designed to support multiple *tombala* sessions simultaneously.

# 1. Functional Requirements

#### 1.1. Client-Server Connection

User connects to the Tombala Server through any Tombala Client by providing a user name. User name shall be unique across the Tombala server.

User shall be removed from all games when he loses internet connection. Timeout shall be 30 seconds.

#### 1.2. Game Rooms

##### 1.2.1. Creating a game room

The system shall support multiple games simultaneously.

Every user shall be able to create a new game room. User shall provide a countdown value to arrange start date of the game. Game starts after coundown interval ends.

##### 1.2.2. Displaying game rooms

User shall display existing rooms.

##### 1.2.3. Joining a game room

User shall join a game room by providing the room's name.
User shall receive an error:
* If the game has already started.
* If user is already in another game room.

##### 1.2.4. Quiting a game room

User shall quit a game room before the game finishes. He can then join any other game if the game is not started.

#### 1.3. The Game

A game card contains three rows and five numbers on each row. It is randomly generated and distributed when the game starts.

A new number should be randomly generated distributed when all users want to proceed to the next turn. This number should be between 1 and 90. User checks whether he has the number for the current turn and proceeds. The game should be on hold until all users proceed to the next turn.

When a user marks every number in a row of the game card, he should announce it as *cinko*. This claim must be validated and distributed to the other users. Users are responsible for following the numbers and announcing cinkos. Game is over when a user achieves three *cinkos*.


# 2. MESSAGE FORMAT

All protocol messages have to contain a keyword which describes the type of the message. This keyword will be called as the header of the message.

Protocol messages contain body field as the content. The format of the body message is Javascript Object Notation(JSON). You can find JSON format documentation here: http://json.org/

Header keyword and and body message is seperated with a colon character.

    {HEADER_KEYWORD}:{BODY_MESSAGE}

There are two general types of communication:

1. After user actions, client issues a request with relevant header and server responses with an error or success header.

2. When state changes on the server, it broadcasts messages to related clients.

All messages shall close with a line break character \n.

## 2.1. Client Request Format

Tombala clients are responsible for adding a request identifier to the body message. The identifier is added to the response body by the server, and client uses that to correspond server responses with the relavant request. The identifier will be called as sequence number.

Sequence numbers are integers generated on the client side. They are not manipulated but simply echoed in responses.

**Client Request Types**

- CHBEAT: Client Heartbeat
- CLOGIN: Client Login
- CCROOM: Client Create Room
- CLROOM: Client List Rooms
- CJROOM: Client Join Room
- CQROOM: Client Quit Room
- CCINKO: Client Cinko
- CNNMBR: Client Next Number

**Server Response Types for Client Requests**

- SSUCCS: Server response with success
- SERROR: Server response with error

## 2.2. Server Broadcast Format

Server broadcasts messages about a room to the connected clients when state changes for the room.

- BGCARD: Broadcast Game Card
- BNUMBR: Broadcast New Number
- BCINKO: Broadcast Cinko
- BUSRLS: Broadcast User List

# 3.1. Client Requests

#### CHBEAT : Client Heartbeat

Client heartbeat message is just used to inform the server that the client is still connected.

*CHBEAT* messages are expected to be sent regularly while the client is online. Expected interval time is 10 seconds. Client will be considered as disconnected when there is no heartbeat in the last 30 seconds. Disconnected clients will be removed from their active tombala rooms and game continues in those rooms.

Example Request:

    CHBEAT:{
        "seq": 111
    }

Example Response:

    SSUCCS:{
        "seq": 111
    }

#### CLOGIN: Client Login

*CLOGIN* is used to set a username for client connection. This request is needed to authenticate the client on the server and it must be issued before any other request.

Request fields:

    }

#### CCROOM: Client Create Room

*CCROOM* is used to create a new game room.

Request fields:

# 3.2. Server Broadcasts

Broadcast messages are issued from server when the room's state changes. Clients are subscribed to those broadcast messages when they join the room.

Message fields:

- **gamecard**(*array*): It has three rows represeting rows in an actual game card.

Message fields:

- **number**(*integer*): A random number generated on the server. Minimum 1, maximum 90. Generated numbers must be unique for any given game session. Clients use this number to mark their game cards. Clients have to issue *CNEXT* request using this number as a parameter for proceeding to next turn.
